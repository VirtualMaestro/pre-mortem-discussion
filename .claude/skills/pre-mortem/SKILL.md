# /pre-mortem — Multi-Agent Pre-Mortem (Spec v4.2)

This skill orchestrates a structured multi-agent pre-mortem with explicit user gates.
Scaffolded by `npx pre-mortem-discussion`.

## Non-goals
- This skill does **not** auto-run on scaffold.
- This skill never writes/overwrites `.claude/agents/*` (agents are a library written on first use by the skill runtime, not by the scaffolder).

## Runtime primitive (IMPORTANT)
This environment's callable primitive is the **`Agent` tool**.
- Any `Task(...)` references are pseudocode only.

Pseudocode mapping:
- `Task(subagent_type, description, prompt)` → `Agent({ subagent_type, description, prompt, model, ... })`

## Defaults
- Critic model default: **opus**.
- Trigger matching: **token + phrase** support; case-insensitive; avoid substring false positives.

## Roles and tools
Orchestrator tools: `Read, Write, Glob, Grep, AskUserQuestion`.
Critics tools: `Read, Glob, Grep` (read-only).

## File layout (normative)
Skill assets live under:
- `.claude/skills/pre-mortem/*`

Session artifacts live under:
- `discussions/{session_id}/*` including `state.json`, `round*.md`, `round*.json`, and `round2.jsonl`.

## Human gates (MUST use AskUserQuestion)
No round begins without explicit user approval.
- Gate 0: critic/domain selection (before Round 1)
- Gate 1: after Round 1 synthesis
- Gate 2: after Round 2 synthesis
- Gate 3: after Round 3 synthesis / final approval

## Deterministic domain selection (Gate 0)
1) Read `.claude/skills/pre-mortem/domains.md`.
2) Score each domain by trigger hits in the user spec.
   - Tokens: exact token match after tokenization (preferred)
   - Phrases: exact phrase match
   - Case-insensitive
   - Avoid substring matches (`auth` must not match `author`).
3) Keep domains with score >= 2 OR explicitly requested by the user.
4) Always include `tech-critic` for technical specs.
5) Cap at 5 (highest scores).
6) Ask user to approve/modify the list (Gate 0). Do not proceed without approval.

## Agent execution model
- Do NOT route via named `subagent_type` (file-based discovery unreliable). Always use `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`.
- Inject persona + round instructions inline in the `prompt`.

Normative call skeleton:
```text
Agent({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  description: "{domain}-critic: pre-mortem round {N}",
  prompt: "{CANONICAL_PROMPT_BODY}\n\n{ROUND_TASK_INSTRUCTIONS}",
  model: "opus",
  resume: "",
  run_in_background: false,
  name: "",
  team_name: "",
  mode: "default",
  isolation: "worktree"
})
```

## Critic output (STRICT)
Each critic returns exactly **one JSON object** (no preamble text).
Required top-level keys:
- `agent` (string)
- `round` (number)
- `domain_assessment` (string, 1-2 sentences, required even if risks is empty)
- `risks` (array, may be empty)
- `contradictions_noted` (array)

Each risk item must include:
- `id` (e.g. `sec-r1-001`)
- `name`
- `severity` in `{High, Med, Low}`
- `confidence` in `{High, Med, Low}` (optional, defaults to `Med`)
- `description` (style rule: “X happens when Y, causing Z”)
- `solution`, `tradeoff`
- `blocking_question` (string or null)
Optional:
- `spec_reference` (string, direct quote or specific reference from spec)
- `scenario`: `{ when, happens, impact }`
- `updates_risk_id`
- `references` (array)

Canonical contradiction object schema (used everywhere):
```json
{
  "from_agent": "tech-critic",
  "against_agent": "security-critic",
  "risk_id": "sec-r1-002",
  "summary": "..."
}
```

## Orchestrator strict checks
- JSON parseability
- Required fields present: `agent`, `round`, `domain_assessment`, `risks`, `contradictions_noted`
- `domain_assessment` must be non-empty string
- `risks` must be array (empty array is valid)
- Severity in `{High, Med, Low}` (if invalid, skip that risk)
- Confidence: if missing or invalid, default to `Med` and log warning
- File naming + state transitions
- Prompt drift check + user gate

Best-effort only (do not fail run): narrative phrasing pattern, perfect schema conformance beyond strict checks.

## Orchestrator behavior for new fields

### domain_assessment rendering
When `risks` is empty:
```markdown
## {agent} — Round {N}
✅ No risks identified in this domain.
Assessment: {domain_assessment}
---
```

When `risks` is non-empty:
```markdown
## {agent} — Round {N}
Assessment: {domain_assessment}

🚩 **[{severity} / {confidence}-conf] {risk_name}**
...
---
```

### spec_reference flagging
For each risk where `spec_reference` is absent or generic:
- Set `needs_verification: true` in state.json risk_register
- Add warning to .md log: `⚠️  {risk_id}: no spec reference — flagged for architect review`

A spec_reference is **generic** if it contains only phrases like "based on the overall approach", "given the architecture described", "the system as designed", "implied by the tech stack". When in doubt, treat as generic.

A spec_reference is **specific** if it:
- Contains a verbatim quote from the spec (any length), OR
- Names a concrete design decision, component, or section by exact name

### confidence rendering
Render confidence inline in .md logs:
```
🚩 **[High / High-conf] JWT secret stored in env var**
🚩 **[Med / Low-conf] Missing rate limiting**
```

Include in Gate summaries:
```
Round 1: 12 risks — High-conf: 7, Med-conf: 4, Low-conf: 1
```

Store `confidence` in each risk_register entry in state.json.

## Failure handling (STRICT)

### FAILED response (unparseable JSON or missing top-level required fields)
If a critic returns unparseable JSON or missing `agent`, `round`, `domain_assessment`, or `risks`:
- Record a FAILED stub entry into the round output
- Render FAILED in the Markdown log: `## {agent} — FAILED: unparseable or missing required fields`
- Mark `round_responses[N][agent] = "failed"` in `state.json`
- Continue without retry

### Malformed risk object (within valid response)
If a single risk object is missing required fields (`id`, `name`, `severity`, `description`):
- Skip that risk only
- Log in .md: `⚠️ 1 malformed risk object skipped in {agent} Round {N} response`
- Count valid risks only toward round totals
- Do not fail the entire agent response

### Field-level defaults
- `contradictions_noted`: if absent, default to `[]` and log warning
- `confidence`: if missing or invalid, default to `"Med"` and log warning
- `severity`: if invalid, skip the containing risk (do not default)

Rationale: `severity` is a core routing field — invalid severity would silently miscategorize the risk. `confidence` is supplementary signal — defaulting to `Med` is safe.

Round 2 persistence (robust): append each critic response as a line to `round2.jsonl`; at end compile to `round2.json` array.

## Prompt canonicalization + drift handling (STRICT)
- Agent prompts live in `.claude/agents/{name}.md` and are treated as canonical.
- Store `sha256(normalized_body_after_yaml)` per agent in `state.json.agent_prompt_sha256`.
- If current hash != stored hash:
  - set `state.status = "prompt_drift_detected"`
  - AskUserQuestion:
    - Use updated prompt (store new hash; continue), OR
    - Keep prior prompt for reproducibility (abort unless prior body is available in logs)

## Architect Mode B filter (post-debate)

After all debate rounds complete, the orchestrator switches to Architect Mode and makes two distinct passes over the risk_register before writing the final output artifact.

### Pass A: Verify unanchored risks (needs_verification: true)
For each risk where `needs_verification: true`:
- Architect reads the spec and checks whether the risk is actually grounded
- **If grounded:** remove `needs_verification` flag, keep risk as-is
- **If not grounded:** set `status: "dismissed"`, log to console:
  ```
  [ARCHITECT] Dismissed · {risk_id} · {risk_name}
    Reason: {one-line explanation}
  ```

### Pass B: Label low-confidence risks (confidence: "Low")
For each risk where `confidence: "Low"` and `status != "dismissed"`:
- Include in output artifact with `⚠️ Low confidence` label
- Add to dedicated `## Low-Confidence Risks` subsection in output artifact
- Add note: "These risks may become relevant depending on implementation choices not yet specified in the spec."

### Final output artifact content
- All `High` and `Med` confidence risks with `status != "dismissed"` → main risk register
- All `Low` confidence risks with `status != "dismissed"` → separate subsection with label
- All `dismissed` risks → not in artifact, preserved in round JSON for audit

**Pass A always executes before Pass B. Risks dismissed in Pass A are excluded from Pass B processing.**

## Extra rounds
Default: extra rounds are **parallel filter** rounds (Round 3 semantics) unless user explicitly requests sequential.
